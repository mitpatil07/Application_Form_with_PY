# Application Form using Python Tkinter and MySQL

## Overview

This project is an application form built using Python's Tkinter library for the frontend, and MySQL as the backend database. The form collects user information and stores it in a MySQL database for further use. 

## Features

- User-friendly interface using Tkinter.
- Real-time data entry validation.
- Connects to MySQL for storing, updating, and retrieving form data.
- Handles error scenarios (like invalid inputs, connection errors, etc.)

## Prerequisites

Before you run this project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed.
- MySQL server installed and running.
- Required Python packages (mentioned below).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/application-form-tkinter-mysql.git
   cd application-form-tkinter-mysql
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. Create a MySQL database and a table to store the form data:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE formdb;
   USE formdb;

   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       email VARCHAR(100),
       phone VARCHAR(20),
       address TEXT
   );
   ```

4. Modify the MySQL connection settings in the script to match your environment:

   ```python
   mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
       host="localhost",
       user="yourusername",
       password="yourpassword",
       database="formdb"
   )
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Enter your details in the form fields and click "Submit". The data will be stored in the MySQL database.

## Folder Structure

```
- app.py           # Main script for running the Tkinter app
